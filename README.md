This project aims to offer a fast :zap: and reliable data augmentation generator of **NIR spectra**

## This project is currently a Work in Progress!

To do:

- [x] implement basic PyTorch support
- [x] implement basic augments compatibility with PyTorch
- [ ] Test on data and compare results
- [ ] Add documentation
